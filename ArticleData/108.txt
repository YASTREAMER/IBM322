What is JioCinema and how does it work?
JioCinema is fast becoming a major video streaming service in India. With its enormous library of both local and international content, including tie-ups with HBO, the platform continues to offer a vast array of options when it comes to entertainment.
From the streamer’s price tiers to how to sign up and the content library, here’s everything you need to know about JioCinema.
Unlike Netflix, which is a paid OTT platform, JioCinema works differently. It is a freemium video streaming service, which can be experienced in both free tier and premium tier. 
Like many local platforms, the free tier is backed by ads and even the streaming resolution is limited to 1080p. But there is an ad-free tier as well which offers up to 4K resolution streaming on select titles.
The premium subscription of JioCinema costs Rs 999 a year. Viewers can watch in Ultra HD where available, on four devices at a time. With the premium tier, the perk includes additional content like exclusive premiers, original catalogue of classic shows like Sex and the City and Silicon Valley.
Users just need a working phone number to sign-up on JioCinema for free of cost. Although it’s a product of Jio, users with Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and BSNL SIM cards can also sign-up for JioCinema.
Right now, JioCinema has partnered with studios like HBO and Peacock to offer exclusive global content in India, where, users can enjoy movies and TV shows like Game of Thrones, Succession, Sex and the City, Silicon Valley, and more.
JioCinema is available on all the major platforms, including Android, iOS, Android TV, Apple TV, webOS, and even Samsung Tizen TV OS. Besides, JioCinema can also be accessed via a standard web browser on devices like PCs and laptops.
JioCinema has content in over 10 Indian languages, including Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Malayalam, and more.
Voot, another popular OTT platform by Viacom18 is merging with JioCinema. Hence, all the Voot content will be migrated to JioCinema, which includes BigBoss, movies, and other exclusive TV shows. Similarly, Voot is also offering a coupon code for its Voot premium subscribers, which can be used to get additional discounts on JioCinema premium subscriptions.
The availability of JioCinema is currently restricted to India. Users outside India won't be able to access the service, at least as of now.
JioCinema does allow users to download content on Android and iOS devices for both free and premium tier users. This allows users to watch content even while travelling and in challenging network situations.

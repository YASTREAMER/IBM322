Amazon Prime Lite subscription gets a significant price cut. Check new price and benefits here | Mint
 Amazon has significantly reduced the price of its Prime Lite membership, possibly in an effort to further widen the gap between the ad-supported subscription and the regular Prime membership.
   The Amazon Prime Lite membership is now available in India for an annual price of  ‚Çπ799 as compared to the original launch price of  ‚Çπ999. Meanwhile, the e-commerce giant has decided to keep the prices of its Amazon Prime plan unchanged, with prices starting at  ‚Çπ299 for a one-month subscription,  ‚Çπ599 for a three-month subscription and  ‚Çπ1,499 for a one-year subscription.
 Amazon Prime Lite subscription benefits:Amazon Prime Lite membership allows users to take advantage of free one-day delivery, two-day delivery, scheduled delivery and same-day delivery from Amazon, and does not require a minimum order value to qualify for free delivery. In addition, like regular Prime users, Amazon Prime Lite customers are also eligible for a cashback of  ‚Çπ25 if they opt for no-rush delivery.        Prime Lite customers also get early access to Amazon's Lightning Deals and Deals of the Day which are only available to Prime customers.     Prime Lite membership also allows customers to stream unlimited videos, movies and TV shows from India and around the world. However, there is a limit on the number of streaming devices, allowing only two devices in HD quality and users will also have to put up with advertisements while streaming on Prime Video.    However, Prime Lite customers do not get access to Amazon's Prime Music, Prime Reading and Prime Gaming services and pay a delivery fee of  ‚Çπ175 for morning delivery as compared to  ‚Çπ50 paid by regular Amazon Prime users.

 IEA 2020 carbon footprint streaming video fact checking headlines IEA Paris https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-carbon-footprint-of-streaming-video-fact-checking-the-headlines 

 version commentary originally published Carbon Brief 

 millions confined homes global pandemic improvements internet connections service offerings led exponential increase use streaming video world options left entertainment streaming services taking commentary examine carbon footprint services 

 Streaming services associated energy use carbon emissions devices network infrastructure data centres contrary slew recent misleading media coverage climate impacts streaming video remain relatively modest particularly compared activities sectors 

 Drawing analysis credible sources expose flawed assumptions widely reported estimate emissions watching 30 minutes Netflix exaggerate actual climate impact 90 times 

 relatively low climate impact streaming video today thanks rapid improvements energy efficiency data centres networks devices slowing efficiency gains rebound effects new demands emerging technologies including artificial intelligence AI blockchain raise increasing concerns overall environmental impacts sector coming decades 

 Update 11/12/2020 energy intensity figures data centres data transmission networks updated reflect recent data research result central IEA estimate hour streaming video 2019 36gCO2 82gCO2 original analysis published February 2020 updated charts comparisons include corrected values published Shift Project June 2020 recent estimates quoted media 

 number recent media articles including New York Post CBC Yahoo DW Gizmodo Phys.org BigThink repeated claim emissions generated watching 30 minutes Netflix 1.6   kg CO2 driving 4 miles 

 figures come July 2019 report Shift Project French thinktank unsustainable growing impact online video report said streaming responsible 300 m tonnes CO2 MtCO2 2018 equivalent emissions France Shift Project published follow article June 2020 correct bit byte conversion error revising original 1.6 kg half hour quote downwards 8 fold 0.2 kg half hour 

 Shift Project original 3.2kgCO2 hour estimate times higher 2014 peer reviewed study energy emissions impacts streaming video corrected estimate 0.4kgCO2 hour similar 2014 peer reviewed study 

 2014 study found streaming 2011 emitted 0.42kgCO2e hour lifecycle basis including embodied emissions manufacture disposal infrastructure devices Emissions operations comparable scope Shift Project analysis accounted 0.36kgCO2e hour 

 energy efficiency data centres networks improving rapidly doubling couple years energy use emissions streaming today substantially lower 

 Looking electricity consumption original Shift Project figures imply hour Netflix consumes 6.1 kilowatt hours kWh electricity drive Tesla Model S 30 km power LED lightbulb constantly month boil kettle day nearly months corrected figures imply hour Netflix consumes 0.8 kWh 

 167 million Netflix subscribers watching   average hours day corrected Shift Project figures imply Netflix streaming consumes 94 terawatt hours   TWh year 200 times larger figures reported Netflix 0.45TWh 2019 

 recent claim Channel 4 Dispatches estimated 7bn YouTube views 2017 hit song Despacito Luis Fonsi Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Beiber   consumed 900 gigawatt hours GWh electricity 1.66 kWh viewing hour rate YouTube 1 billion viewing hours day consume 600   TWh year 2.5 global electricity use electricity globally data centres ~200 TWh data transmission networks ~250 TWh 

 clear figures high 

 assumptions Shift Project analysis largely based 2015 paper assumptions significantly revised 2019 2020 contain series flaws taken seriously exaggerate electricity consumed streaming video 

 original 1.6 kg half hour claim overestimated bitrate data transferred second streaming apparently assuming figure 24 megabits second Mbps equivalent 10.8 gigabytes GB hour times higher global average bitrate Netflix 2019 4.1 Mbps 1.9 GB hr excluding cellular networks triple transfer rate high definition HD 3 GB hr typical transfer rates 7 GB hr ultra high definition UHD/4 K 0.7 GB hr standard definition SD 0.25 GB hr mobile 

 difference stemmed stated assumption 3Mbps apparently converted error 3 megabytes second MBps byte equivalent bits Shift Project corrected error June 2020 update revise assumptions discussed 

 chart shows ways Shift Project overestimated electricity use streaming video   bitrate   area underestimated actual figure errors described text chart 

 Shift Project analysis overestimates energy intensity data centres   content delivery networks CDNs   serve streaming video consumers 35 fold relative figures derived   2019 Netflix electricity consumption data   subscriber usage data 

 updated analysis shows Shift Project overestimates energy intensity data transmission networks 50 fold based average bitrates streaming video result high outdated energy use assumptions access modes   example 0.9 kWh GB mobile compared recent peer reviewed estimates 0.1 0.2 kWh GB 4 G mobile 2019  

 original February 2020 analysis showed Shift Project assumptions data transmission energy intensity 0.15 0.88 kWh GB higher recent estimates 0.025 0.23kWh GB latest research shows data based intensity values kWh GB appropriate estimating network energy use high bitrate applications streaming video Instead experts advise time based energy intensity values kWh viewing hour assumptions data transmission energy use updated time based energy intensity values 

 Shift Project   underestimates   energy consumption devices 4 fold assumes viewing occurs smartphones 50 laptops 50   According Netflix 70 viewing occurs TVs energy intensive laptops 15 viewing tablets 10 smartphones 5 

 Taken updated analysis suggests streaming Netflix video 2019 typically consumed 0.077   kWh electricity hour 80 times original estimate Shift Project 6.1   kWh 10 times corrected estimated 0.78   kWh shown chart left results highly sensitive choice viewing device type network connection resolution shown chart right 

 example 50 inch LED television consumes electricity smartphone 100 times laptop 5 times phones extremely energy efficient data transmission accounts 80 electricity consumption streaming Streaming hour long SD video phone WiFi Scenario C uses 0.037 kWh 170 times estimate Shift Project 

 Based average viewing habits updated analysis shows viewing devices account majority energy use 72 followed data transmission 23 data centres 5 contrast Shift Project values devices account 2 total energy use result underestimating energy use devices 4x substantially overestimating energy use data centres 35x data transmission 50x 

 carbon footprint streaming video depends electricity usage set CO2 emissions associated unit electricity generation 

 electricity end uses electric vehicles means overall footprint streaming video depends heavily electricity generated 

 Powered global average electricity mix streaming 30 minute Netflix 2019 released 0.018kgCO2e 18 grammes second bar chart 90 times original 1.6 kg figure Shift Project 11 times corrected figure 0.2 kg 

 IEA estimate substantially lower estimates quoted media including 22 times lower Despacito claim cited Channel 4 BBC Fortune Al Jazeera assuming global average grid mix 11 times lower claim Save Energy 80 million views Birdbox emitted 66ktCO2 cited New Yorker Euronews Forbes Die Welt Daily Mail estimate 36gCO2 hour 2100 times lower Marks et al 2020 estimated 35 hours HD video emits 2.68tCO2 77kgCO2 hour 

 context updated estimate average carbon footprint half hour Netflix equivalent driving 100 metres conventional car 

 chart shows figure depends heavily generation mix country question France   90 electricity comes low carbon sources emissions 2gCO2e equivalent 10 metres   driving  

 country average emission factors overestimate emissions particularly data centres Technology firms operating large data centres leaders corporate procurement clean energy accounting   half renewable power purchase agreements   recent years

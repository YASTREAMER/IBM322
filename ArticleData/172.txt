Hulu Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024) - Business of Apps
Updated: March 1, 2024
Video streaming service Hulu started its life with major backing from new and old media, receiving investment and content from NBC Universal, MSN, MySpace and Yahoo in 2007 before launching early in 2008.
Hulu entanglement with the media conglomerates of America placed it in stark contrast to Netflix, which while subservient to the licensing demands of the industry, is considered an independent operator. For most of its existence, the majority of Hulu was owned by one or several media companies, ending with Disney acquiring a majority share in 2019. 
This perception of Hulu as a place film and TV studios dump content is a misconception, created during the era when several media companies had stakes in the company but did not want to launch any new titles on it. Before that period it was competitive with Netflix, attempting to break new ground with innovative online partnerships. - Advertisement - Sadly for Hulu, it was always in the shadow of Netflix, as its rival added millions of customers every year in North America, Europe and South America. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video both launched original TV series in 2015, another move that pushed the video streaming services away from old media’s control.  It would take Hulu two years to copy Netflix and Prime Video’s model, launching The Handmaid’s Tale in 2017. It became an instant hit for the streaming service, and provided Hulu with a way to rebrand as a content producer in its own right, instead of an aggregator of old television shows and movies.  As Hulu started to gain traction through its original series, Disney began to acquire more of it from other media conglomerates. First came the acquisition of 30 percent of Hulu from 21st Century Fox, then a month later AT&T sold 10 percent of the company to Disney. A month after that, Comcast announced it would sell its 33 percent share to Disney by 2024, ceding full control.  Disney, in comparison to Comcast and 21st Century Fox, has implemented one of the smartest digital strategies in the past decade. In its first year, Disney+ has almost reached 100 million subscribers worldwide, and ESPN+ has over 10 million subscribers.  With the move to control Hulu completely, it looks likely that the app will be folded into Disney+ in the near future. Hulu TV shows and movies will be available on Disney+ soon, the first nail in the coffin of Hulu as its own service. Hulu also offers a live TV service similar to YouTube TV and other internet-based live TV services. It charges much more for this, and it comes with 75 channels, ESPN+ and Disney+.

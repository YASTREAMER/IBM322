Reminder: A Big Change for Hulu Subscribers Goes Into Effect TODAY! - AllEars.Net
We posted about this change at the beginning of February, but we are back to remind you that a new change is going into effect today for Hulu subscribers.
While it may not be good news, we want to make sure we keep you updated!

Beginning on March 14th, 2024, Hulu will be cracking down on password-sharing amongst subscribers.
Hulu sent an email on January 31st letting subscribers know of this change. This update specifically prohibits the sharing of accounts outside of the user’s household.
The email stated, “Unless otherwise permitted by your Service Tier, you may not share your subscription outside of your household. ‘Household’ means the collection of devices associated with your primary personal residence that are used by the individuals who reside therein.”
This change does not come as a surprise, though, as Disney+ also announced changes to password-sharing rules back in October 2023, and a beta feature is currently being tested that combines Hulu and Disney+ in one platform.
Start reigning in your password-sharing as this change officially goes into effect today, March 14th!

That’s great, except they haven’t, as far as I can see, given any info about adding family members (say, a kid at college) and how much it would cost, etc.

The Indian Premier League (IPL 2024) is set to kick-start later today (Friday, March 22), with a blockbuster clash between Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangaluru (CSK vs RCB) in Chennai.

For the second year in a row, the fans would be able to enjoy the world’s biggest T20 league for free on Star Sports (satellite TV) and JioCinema (digital).

Ahead of the tournament opener, both broadcasters are trying to woo the fans to enjoy the IPL on their platform through various offerings, including their star-studded list of commentators.

"I think #ViratKohli will play for another 4 years", says @sherryontopp, in admiration of the King's positive attitude, aggression & confidence while playing the game! 👏🏼Catch even more awesome Sidhuisms as he makes his rip-roaring comeback in TATA #IPL2024! 💯Tune-in to… pic.twitter.com/NILJBCrtEK
While Star Sports has onboarded Navjot Singh Sidhu, bringing back the old vibes, the digital streaming site JioCinema has also released an equally impressive list of commentators, who will be sharing their insights about the game in around 12 regional languages.

However, JioCinema’s one particular decision to woo the customers seems to have backfired, with the majority of the fans strongly rejecting their choice.

The Viacom 18-backed company announced on X, formerly Twitter, that they have brought several social media influencers on board, including Orry to “double the fun and entertainment” during this year’s IPL.

Livers, Orry is on #JioCinema and so is #TATAIPL 🤩Double the fun, double the entertainment 🥳Watch #IPLonJioCinema starting 👉 22nd March 📲#IPL2024 #JioCinemaSports pic.twitter.com/AaP43beqxG
“Livers, Orry is on #JioCinema and so is #TATAIPL Double the fun, double the entertainment,” JioCinema wrote on X, along with a clip of Orry urging fans to join him in the celebration.

While those who look at IPL as a mere source of entertainment might not have any issue with Orry’s inclusion, the die-hard fans, who consider the cash-rich league a serious business, couldn’t understand the rationale behind this decision and they expressed the same on social media.

“Jio Cinema You Lost My Respect Today Don't call this shameless in your Show otherwise we will watch ipl on Star sports @JioCinema,” wrote one fan.

Jio Cinema You Lost My Respect Today 🥴Don't call this shameless in your Show otherwise we will watch ipl on Star sports @JioCinema
“Such cringe. Laut aao Sony Max!” commented another.

Such cringe.Laut aao Sony Max! 😢😭😭
“Just when I thought cricket coverage couldn't get any worse. This is a new all time low for us fans!” read another fan.

Just when I thought cricket coverage couldn't get any worse....  This is a new all time low for us fans !!!
Are u seriously kidding me???
i am not watching jio cinema even if you give 8k broadcast 😭😭
Personally, I also don’t get what JioCinema wants to achieve by bringing Orry on to their guest panel for the IPL 2024 games.

All the Jobbers, Painters and Livers, get ready #IPLonJioCinema with Orry 🤩🔥Catch him live ahead of #CSKvRCB, 6pm onwards, only on JioCinema 🙌#TATAIPL #IPL2024 pic.twitter.com/rIum1C5VN5
The only good thing is that JioCinema has multiple language options to choose from and it would help me save eardrums.

Netflix’s Strong Subscriber Growth and Financial Performance Bolster Buy Rating | Markets Insider
Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen has reiterated their bullish  stance on NFLX stock, giving a Buy rating today.
Tim Nollen has given his Buy rating due to a combination of factors that underscore Netflix’s strong performance and future growth potential. In the first quarter, Netflix exceeded expectations with a substantial increase in subscribers, adding 9.3 million compared to the 4 million anticipated, bringing the total to 270 million subscribers. This growth, along with a 15% increase in revenue, indicates robust business health. Furthermore, the operating income for Netflix was notably impressive, yielding a 28% margin which surpassed the forecasted 26.7%. 
Moreover, Netflix has raised its operating margin guidance for 2024 from 24% to 25%, signaling confidence in its operational efficiency, despite maintaining its free cash flow guidance at $6 billion. Nollen also sees potential in Netflix’s burgeoning advertising business, which is gaining the necessary scale to meet burgeoning advertiser demand, and believes this will contribute to revenue acceleration. The decision to shift focus from providing regular subscriber and Average Revenue per Membership (ARM) figures to more fundamental metrics is also viewed positively, drawing a parallel to Apple’s strategy, which has been successful. Nollen’s target price of $685 reflects a valuation based on 25 times the projected 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), suggesting a strong conviction in the stock’s upside.
In another report released today, Morgan Stanley also assigned a Buy rating to the stock with a $700.00 price target.

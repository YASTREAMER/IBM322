The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 has reached a remarkable milestone in television viewership, breaking all previous records by drawing over 40 crore viewers for its live broadcasts. The matches, which are aired on the Star Sports network, saw a substantial increase in viewing figures, with a total of 12,380 crore minutes watched over 18 matches. This represents a 15 percent rise in watch time from last year's season.
Compared to the 2023 season, where the viewership for 18 matches was 36.4 crore, this year's figures not only show a significant increase but also the highest cumulative audience reach in the history of the IPL. Additionally, the TV ratings (TVR) for the IPL have grown by 17 percent over the past year, indicating a solid and growing fan base for the cricket league on television.
The statement released by Disney, the broadcaster of the IPL, highlighted this growth in viewership as an example to the continuous love and support from fans for watching IPL matches on TV. They believe these numbers reflect how much people enjoy and follow the tournament annually.
One of the new features this year, which likely contributed to the wider reach and positive response, is the inclusion of Indian Sign Language feeds in the broadcasts. This move, along with the use of AI technology, has not only attracted a broader audience but also made the viewing experience more inclusive for everyone.
On the digital front, JioCinema, the official online streaming platform for the IPL, also reported significant growth. On the first day of the tournament alone, the platform had more than 11.3 crore viewers tuning in, marking a 51 percent increase compared to the opening day of the previous season. Moreover, JioCinema, which is broadcasting the IPL for its second consecutive year, registered over 59 crore video views and a whopping 660 crore minutes of watch time on just the opening day.
These figures underscore the immense popularity and engagement that the IPL continues to generate among cricket fans, not just on traditional TV platforms but also online. The success of the IPL's 2024 season in terms of viewership could also be seen as an indicator of how well sports broadcasting adapts and innovates to meet the expectations and preferences of a diverse and evolving audience.
As the tournament progresses, it will be interesting to see how these numbers hold up and whether the innovative approaches in broadcasting continue to draw in viewers, maintaining or even surpassing the initial excitement and engagement levels observed so far.
